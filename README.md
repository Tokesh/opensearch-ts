We are looking for contributors to help us with the rewrite of the OpenSearch Javascript Client. If you are interested in helping out, please reach out to me through Telegram `@timursaurus` or [email](mailto:timursaurus@gmail.com).

## Introduction
This project is a rewrite of the OpenSearch [Javascript Client](https://github.com/opensearch-project/opensearch-js) in TypeScript. The goal is to provide a better developer experience for the OpenSearch [Javascript Client](https://github.com/opensearch-project/opensearch-js). The current version of the OpenSearch Javascript Client is written in JavaScript and is not type safe. This project aims to provide a type safe version of the OpenSearch Javascript Client.
